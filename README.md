# Propane Prices
I do wonder if commodity prices ever goes back to initial price after a hike; I've been observing the flunctuations in gas prices for some years and I do wonder if consumers have ever had the oppotunity to enjoy a low price after a hike. The [National Propane Gas Association](https://www.npga.org/news-resources/2020-residential-energy-consumption-survey-recs/) noted that 9% of U.S. households utilize propane for at least one residential application excluding grilling; I'm just curious to see if these consumers have had any chance to enjoy low prices in the past or if there could be in the future. In this analysis, I looked at the price of propane over some years and also create a model to see if there is any relieve for consumers in 2025.
